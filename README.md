> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - I learned Markdown and typed this deliverable in it.
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - My elevator pitch explains why HABITat is helpful and introduces it's key functions.
- [x] Description of key features - I listened the main features of my startup.
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology - I listed how I will use HTML, CSS, React, Service, DB/Login, and WebSocket technologies in my startup.
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references. - I included a mockup for the dashboard page that I created using NinjaMock.

### Elevator pitch

Tired of feeling forgetful, unmotivated, or disorganized? Then HABITat is for you! This gamified daily to-do list allows you to compete against your friends and see if you have the highest consistency. As your daily streaks grow, you'll earn badges, climb the leaderboard, and make progress in your life. HABITat: a place where good habits grow.

### Design

### Key features

- Register/login to create an account.
- Add and track daily habits (such as going to the gym, drinking water, etc.)
- Earn streaks when you complete habits daily.
- Earn badges and climb the leaderboard as your streak increases.
- Compete with friends: see their streaks and leaderboard ranking.
- Motivational quotes appear each day to keep users inspired. 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Will be used to create the basic structure of 3 web pages:
    - Login/register page
    - Main dashboard with habits and condensed leaderboard
    - Full leaderboard page
- **CSS** - Will be used to style my pages. I plan to use a mostly green color palette to match the "HABITat" theme.
- **React** - Will provide login, add/remove/check off habits, increasing/refreshing streaks, and routing between pages.
- **Service** - I will be using third party services to generate inspirational quotes and the current date. My backend service will have endpoints for:
    - Login/registration
    - Retrieving a user's data
    - Submitting completed habits
- **DB/Login** - Will securely store user credentials, streak data, badges, and leadership info in a database.
- **WebSocket** - As users complete habits, their streaks are updated in real time on other users' leaderboards.
